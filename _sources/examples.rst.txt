Examples
========

This section provides practical code examples and usage patterns for the Hajduk engine and game. Use these as a reference for common tasks and as templates for your own features.

Basic Player Movement
---------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from entities.player import Player
    from map.map import Map

    player = Player(x=5, y=5)
    game_map = Map(width=20, height=20)
    # Plan a path (example: right 3 tiles)
    player.planned_path = [(6, 5), (7, 5), (8, 5)]
    player.planned_path_costs = [1, 1, 1]
    player.action_points = 3
    player.confirm_move(game_map)
    print(player.x, player.y)  # Output: 8 5

NPC Turn Example
----------------
.. code-block:: python

    from entities.npc import NPC
    from core.game import Game

    npc = NPC(x=10, y=10)
    game = Game(screen=None)  # Use a mock or real screen as needed
    npc.take_turn(game)
    # NPC will chase or wander depending on player visibility

Inventory Management
--------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from entities.player import Player
    from entities.item import Item

    player = Player(x=0, y=0)
    sword = Item(name="Sword", weight=5)
    player.add_item(sword)
    print(player.inventory)
